# Python as a Second language

This documentation is intended for anyone learning Python as a second (or third) programming language. It covers topics that mostly fall between the content of [How to Think like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) by Allen Downey and [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum. It should also help students transitioning from CS1 (Introduction to Programming) to CS2 (Algorithms and Data Structures).
