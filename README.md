# Python as a Second language

This document is intended for anyone learning Python as a second (or third) programming language. It covers topics that mostly fall between the content of [How to Think like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) by Allen Downey and [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

It should help students transitioning from CS1 (Introduction to Programming) to CS2 (Algorithms and Data Structures).

This document is not meant to replace other wonderful resources but rather supplement them and address specific questions I'm answering while teaching Algorithms and Data Structures at Luther College.

This document uses Python 3.7 and some examples may not work with earlier versions.
