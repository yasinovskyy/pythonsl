Welcome to Python as a Second Language!
=======================================

**This is not a book but rather a collection of notes and links to other resources.**

This document is intended for anyone learning Python as a second (or third) programming language. It covers topics that mostly fall between the content of `How to Think like a Computer Scientist <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html>`_ by Allen Downey and `Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>`_ by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

It should help students transitioning from CS1 (Introduction to Programming) to CS2 (Algorithms and Data Structures).

This document is not meant to replace other :doc:`resources <reading>` but rather supplement them and address specific questions I'm answering while teaching Algorithms and Data Structures at Luther College.

This document uses Python 3.7.
