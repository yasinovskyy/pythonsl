Data Types
==========

Python is a dynamically typed language and you don't have to specify a variable type like you do in C++ or Java. At the same time, you should not abuse this feature of the language and reuse the same name for conceptually different variables.

Numbers
-------

Numbers are good.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/data_types/numbers.py
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   :linenos:
 
This code does something and generates the following output:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/data_types/numbers.txt
   :language: none
   :caption: Output

.. warning::

    Some C++/Java feature that is not in Python.

Strings
